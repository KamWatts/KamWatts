# Why I Became a Software Developer

I became a software developer because I wanted a career that combined my passions for technology, public safety, and web design. After working in customer service, event planning, military operations, and law enforcement, I realized that I wanted to make a larger impact on society while having the freedom to pursue my goals and passions. Software development offered the perfect combination of creative problem-solving, high demand, financial stability, and potential for growth. I'm particularly interested in the psychology behind effective web design and how it can improve user experiences. My ultimate goal is to launch a tech startup that addresses social issues and promotes education and opportunities in underprivileged communities.

# Professional Competencies

Teamwork: I believe that effective teamwork is key to achieving any goal, whether it's delivering a project on time or responding to a crisis situation. In my previous roles, I worked closely with colleagues and other departments to ensure that we provided the best possible service to our customers and community. I understand the importance of clear communication, active listening, and collaboration to achieve common objectives.

Communication: Clear and effective communication is essential in any professional setting, especially when dealing with complex technical concepts. When I worked in public safety, I developed strong communication skills through daily interactions with customers, colleagues, and stakeholders. I learned to adjust my communication style to suit different audiences and situations, and to be sensitive to non-verbal cues and body language.

Flexibility/Adaptability: In today's fast-paced and constantly changing work environment, being adaptable is critical. I have encountered a wide range of situations and had to think on my feet to find solutions. I learned to be flexible and adaptable, to handle multiple tasks and priorities, and to adjust to new technologies and procedures. I believe that these skills are particularly important in software development, where new technologies and methodologies emerge frequently.

Overall, I believe that my competencies in teamwork, communication, and flexibility/adaptability, developed through my previous experiences in customer service and law enforcement, have prepared me well for a career in software development. I'm confident that I can apply these skills to any project or team and contribute to the success of the organization.
